#' Identify and extract statements of COI, Funding and Registration.
#'
#' Takes a TXT file and examines whether any statements of Conflicts of Interest
#'     (COI), Funding or Protocol Registration exist. If any such statements are
#'     found, it also extracts the relevant text.
#'
#' @param filename The name of the TXT as a string.
#' @return A dataframe of results. A dataframe of results. It returns the PMID
#'     of the article (if this was included in the filename and preced by
#'     "PMID"), whether each of 3 indicators of transparency (COI, Funding or
#'     Registration) was identified, the relevant text identified and whether
#'     each labelling function identified relevant text or not. The labeling
#'     functions are eturned to add flexibility in how this package is used; for
#'     example, future definitions of Registration may differ from the one we
#'     used. If a labelling function returns NA it means that it was not run.
